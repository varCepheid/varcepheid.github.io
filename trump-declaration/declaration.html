          When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a people
          to forsake the political bands which have connected them to their
          leader, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
          should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all citizens of the
          United States are endowed by their Constitution with certain
          unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and property;
          that governmental leaders are elected by these citizens, deriving
          their powers from this Constitution; and that, whenever a leader
          becomes destructive of these rights, it is the right of the people to
          deprive him of his power, and to elect new leaders that seem most
          likely to effect the citizens&rsquo; safety and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prudence dictates that a leader well established and freely elected
          should not be deprived of his power for light and transient causes.
          But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing the same
          object, evinces a design to reduce the citizens under his absolute
          control, it is their right and their duty to renounce his leadership.
          Such is now the necessity which constrains us to replace our
          governmental leaders. The history of the current President of the
          United States is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all
          having in direct object the invalidation of the Constitution from
          which he obtained his power, and the establishment of a tyranny over
          these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
        </p>

            He has combined with others to subject us to offenses foreign to the
            United States Constitution and unacknowledged by federal laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has ignored the principle of the separation of powers, denying
            funds to executive departments and agencies thus allocated by
            Congress, and threatening the independent operation of the
            judiciary.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has restricted the freedoms of speech and of the press,
            persecuting universities, law firms, news organizations, and
            individuals for only the sake of personal vindiction, and forcing
            them to oblige his demands.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has mocked the freedom of assembly, deploying military personnel
            to forcibly interrupt a nonviolent protest and apprehend individuals
            participating in it, without probable cause of criminal activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has enabled his officers to seize individuals in their homes
            without warrant.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has denied repeatedly the due process of law to citizens and
            lawful residents, acting solely on allegation and suspicion.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has attempted to repeal the foundational guarantee of birthright
            citizenship.

        <p>
          At each of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress. Our
          successes in these petitions have been answered, not by recognition
          and compliance, but by ignorance and contempt. An elected official,
          whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant,
          is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
        </p>
        <p>
          We, therefore, the people of the United States of America, do publish
          and declare our intentions:
          <br />
          We do not seek independence, as our forefathers once did. We only
          resolve that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
          shall not perish from this earth.
